## Preconfigure Seafile Clients

Normally, when the user installs a fresh seafile client, a login dialog would prompt him/her to fill the server address and user credentials. These behavior can be preconfigured by IT admins so that the users don't need to do it themselves.

There are two ways to preconfigure seafile client:

* On windows, the admin can store the details it in the windows registry.
* On all desktop platforms (win/linux/mac), the admin can also store the details in a file `seafile.ini` in the HOME folder of the user.

### Using Windows Registry

The preconfigure information can be stored in one of the following two places:

* `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile`
* or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile`

If the information is found in both places, the one under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` would take precedence.

**Special Note for 64bit Windows Deployment**

> If you are using 64-bit windows and using HKLM instead of HKCU to deploy your seafile program. please note you need to correct the PrimaryKey to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Seafile` instead of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Seafile`. This is because seafile client is compiled as a 32-bit application on windows.

#### List of Available Preconfigure Options

```
[preconfigure]
PreconfigureDirectory = ~/
PreconfigureUsername = guest@seafile.de
PreconfigureUserToken = t0Ken
PreconfigureServerAddr = https://cloud.seafile.de

```

### How to use run Seafile client as a service on Windows

Seafile client can be configured to run as a daemon using tools like Firedaemon. First configure Seafile as the user it should run - in this example "Administator"ï¼š

```
Parameters for ccnet: -c C:/Users/Administrator/ccnet
Parameters for seaf-daemon: -c C:/Users/Administrator/ccnet -d S:/seafile-data -w S:/Seafile

```

Replace `S:` with the partition you actually use to store `seafile-data` and `Seafile` folder.

You call also use tools like NSSM (the Non-Sucking Service Manager). For more information, please check <https://valdasv.blogspot.jp/2016/06/seafile-client-service.html>

### How to suppress the launch of Seafile client after install on Windows

When the user installs seafile client on windows, the seafile client program would be started immediately after the installation is finished.

While this is the expected action for most users, it may be necessary to disable it sometimes. For example, when the seafile client is installed with Windows Group Policy Object (GPO), the program would be launched with the ADMIN user (instead of the current login user), which would make the program work incorrectly. In such cases, it's desirable to disable the launch of seafile client after installtion.

To disable this behavior:

```
- Key: PreconfigureSuppressLaunchAfterInstall
- Type: REG_SZ
- Value: 1

```

### How to solve the shell icon overlay not shown problem

Windows uses only the first 15 of the entries in the registry 
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers). If there are other programs, like Dropbox and OneDrive, use up the overlay icons, Seafile shell icon overlay will not shown. To solve the problem, just delete the registration entries of other programs.
