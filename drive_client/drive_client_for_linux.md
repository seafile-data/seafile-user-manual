# Using Seafile Drive Client on Linux

## Installing on Debian/Ubuntu

Debian/Ubuntu users can install SeaDrive from our Debian repository.

To install the client, first add the signing key:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 8756C4F765C9AC3CB6B85D62379CE192D401AB61
```

Then add the repo to your apt source list, here we use Debian 8 (jessie) as an example. Change it to "stretch" for Debian 9. Change it to "xenial" for Ubuntu 16.04.

```
echo deb http://deb.seadrive.org jessie main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/seafile.list
sudo apt-get update
```

To install SeaDrive with GUI:

```
sudo apt-get install seadrive-gui
```

To install SeaDrive without GUI:

```
sudo apt-get install seadrive-daemon
```

## Installing on CentOS 7

Add the repo

```
wget -O- https://git.io/seadrive-centos7-repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/seadrive.repo
```

Install SeaDrive Client

```
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y seadrive --enablerepo=cr
```

## Installing on Fedora

Add the repo

```
wget -O- https://git.io/seadrive-fedora-repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/seadrive.repo
```

Install SeaDrive Client

```
sudo yum install -y seadrive
```

## Running SeaDrive with GUI

To use SeaDrive, just run "SeaDrive" from your desktop environment, or type "seadirve-gui" in command line. After logging into your server, the virtual drive will be mounted in `~/SeaDrive.`

## Running SeaDrive without GUI

In some use cases, it is useful to run SeaDrive in a server environment. To use SeaDrive without GUI, you can directly run seadrive-daemon (the background daemon) from command line.

First, you have to obtain an access token from your server.

```
curl -d "username=username@example.com" -d "password=123456" https://seafile.example.com/api2/auth-token/
```

Then you have to prepare a config file for SeaDrive. Let's assume that you save the config file as `~/seadrive.conf.`

```
[account]
server = https://seafile.example.com
username = username@example.com
token = 3131a3a93156f80bc86aa9f12cf794e0364ed57b
is_pro = true

[general]
client_name = johns-ubuntu

[cache]
size_limit = 10GB
clean_cache_interval = 10
```

You can only specify one account in the config file. If you need to switch accounts, you'll have to stop SeaDrive, change config file and restart. Meaning of config options are as following:

* token: The access token you obtained above.
* is_pro: Set to true if your server is Pro edition.
* client_name: This name will be displayed in the device information on the server.
* size_limit: Size limit of local cache space.
* clean_cache_interval: Interval of cache cleaning. The unit is minute.

Then you can start seadrive:

```
seadrive -c ~/seadrive.conf -f -d data-directory [-l logfile] virtual-drive-dir
```

Note that you must give `-f` option in the command line, to make sure seadrive runs in foregound, instead of forking as a daemon. By default, the data directory used by the SeaDrive GUI client will be `~/.seadrive/data`. It's recommended to use this path for data directory to be consistent with the GUI client. The log file path is `~/.seadrive/logs/seadrive.log`.

Sometimes you'll see the following error:

```
fuse: bad mount point `/home/user/SeaDrive': Transport endpoint is not connected
```

You can run `fusermount -u /home/user/SeaDrive` to fix the problem.
